# Order-Management-System

## Description

This project is designed to create a database and graphical user interface (GUI) for managing customer orders in an industrial construction company. It involves setting up a MySQL database, using SQL for data manipulation, and developing the interface using Swing/JavaFX. This project was completed in collaboration with my classmate at ENSA Khouribga.
